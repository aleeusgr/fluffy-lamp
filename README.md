What a Gimbal learner knows about git?
Do we need any more material on git?

Dan: Pull Request is something of an art.

Issue, 
Commit, Merge

Mix: Should we emphasisze gui or cli?

A: vertically vs horizontal?y
At higher level, module could be nested in Dandelion PBL;
Use PBL structure.
Dandelion PBL: assume higher level of git knowledge.

Dan: 
Can do a whole PBL on git; 
what we need to be doing: produce a subset of commands to allow learner to do what they need to do.

Split project into pull Request, or features.
learners encounter the instructions to implement a feature first, then they implements several features following a process:
???
- create feature description
- write unit test
- create pull request.
